# Fault-location-in-distribution-network

## Research motivation and solutions<br>
At present, deep learning has achieved remarkable results in many fields and a lot of work related to data-driven has been done for fault location in distribution network as discussed above, while the deep learning is faced with ***two main challenges*** not considered in previous studies when applied in fault location in distribution network:<br>
* Most of the data obtained based on PMU are steady-state data, while the amount of fault data is relatively small due to the high reliability of the power system. Thus, over-fitting may occur during the  training progress of fault location model by only using the fault data, which would decrease the accuracy of fault location.<br>
* Most of the previous studies assume that the training dataset covers the total operating space of the distribution network, while the historical fault data measured by the PMU cannot completely cover all fault conditions. When a fault condition that does not exist in the training samples needs to be predicted by the pre-trained machine learning model, the fault may not be accurately located.<br>

In order to realize the accurate fault location in multi-source distribution network by using fault data with small size and low completeness, there are the ***breif solutions*** showing as follows:<br>
*	**Convolution-transposed convolution network** ([CTN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8618415)) is adopted to establish the mapping from stable-state data to fault data to realize the estimation of fault conditions not collected in historical dataset. **auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks** ([AC-GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09585.pdf)) based on CNN is proposed here which can effectively learn the distribution characteristics of real fault data and generate high quality samples of fault data in line with the actual situation, thus augmenting the dataset. <br>
*	In view of the extraordinary feature extraction ability of CNN on image recognition, time series signals of fault voltage and current acquired by PMU are stored as multi-dimensional arrays which are similar to the form of images and we leverage a CNN classifier to perform automatic feature extraction on them for locating fault. <br>

## My proposed methodology<br>
The architecture of fault location framework:<br>

![](https://github.com/ZichaoMeng95/Fault-location-in-distribution-network/blob/master/images/Fault%20location%20model%20in%20distribution%20network.png) 

The model can be divided in three parts:

* fault data estimation (constructed by CTN)
* fault data augmentation (constructed by AC-GAN)
* fault location classifier (constructed by CNN)

Firstly, incomplete dataset are input into CTN to get fault estimation dataset.
Secondly, the complete dataset is used as the real data Xreal for training AC-GAN. The augmentation dataset is generated by the trained AC-GAN generator under the specified category code c, and the total dataset is obtained by combining augmentation dataset and  complete dataset.<br>

If you are not familiar with GAN, there is the papper you [need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf).
